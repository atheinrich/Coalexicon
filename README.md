# Coalexicon
Interactive repository and dimensional analysis suite for numerical quantities used in physics. Requires a minimum of Python 3.8 and the following packages: tkinter, functools, time, and fractions.

# General Operation
-  Press "Switch" to switch applications between Symbol Manager and Unit Manager.
-  Press "Enter" in a textbox to submit a value, then click "Save" to retain it.

# Notepad
-  The Notepad is always present at the bottom of the application.
-  Press "‚Üê" or "‚Üí" to move between each of the three pages.
-  Press "‚úó" to clear the current page.

# Symbol Manager
-  This application is an interactive repository with various sorting methods.
-  Use the "Preset" menu to select a system of conventions. The default is "CLX," which primarily differs from "SI/ISO" in its use of grams and coulombs in place of kilograms and amperes.
-  Use the "Category" menu to select which quantities to view.
-  Use the "Sort" menu to select a sorting method.
-  Use the search bar and the "üîç" button to search entries by name.

# Unit Manager
-  This application is a dimensional analysis suite. Switch the "Preset" in Symbol Manager to "SI/ISO" to work in base units of kilograms and amperes.
-  Press "√ó" or "√∑" beneath a unit to add it to the current set of units, which is displayed in the window at the top left.
-  Click inside this display window to copy the current set to the Notepad.
-  Enter non-base units or numbers in the entry box on the right. Supported units are listed in database_conversions. Numerical entries support the "#e#" convention (for the most part). Enter "theme" to change the background.
-  Toggle fractional powers by pressing "uÀ£" on the left prior to "√ó" or "√∑."
-  Add an SI prefix to a unit by selecting a prefix button prior to "√ó" or "√∑."
-  Recall a saved set of units by selecting it in the Favorites list.
-  Press "Common Conversions" or "Related Quantities" to copy the respective data to the Notepad.
-  Press "Clear" to remove the current set of units.
-  Press "Invert" to transform the current set of units to its multiplicative inverse.
-  Press "Convert to Values" to replace all prefixes in the current set of units by their numerical values.
- Press "Convert to Base" to replace all non-base units in the current set of units by their equivalent units and values in the current "Preset."
- Press "Favorites" to add or remove the current set of units to the Favorites list.
- Press "Values" to toggle the visibility of numbers in the display window.
